# Canada PostThis is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [Canada Post APIs](http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/business/productsservices/developers/services/fundamentals.jsf). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [Canada Post APIs](http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/business/productsservices/developers/services/fundamentals.jsf).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/business/productsservices/developers/services/fundamentals.jsf)- [Developer](http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/business/productsservices/developers/services/fundamentals.jsf)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/canadapostcorp)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/canada-post/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the Canada Post APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
